# Playwright_TestApp1

## Overview
This is a mini project focused on automating a To-do App (TodoMVC) using Playwright. The project demonstrates end-to-end testing practices including test automation, assertions, reporting, and debugging capabilities.

## What We've Done So Far

1. ✅ **Installed Playwright and created tests** - Set up Playwright framework with test files
2. ✅ **Automated to-do app interactions** - Created test that:
   - Adds 3 todos to the app
   - Marks items as completed
   - Deletes completed items
   - Verifies todos are visible
3. ✅ **Implemented test tagging** - Added `@sanity` tag to tests for selective test execution
4. ✅ **Generated HTML reports** - Configured Playwright to generate HTML test reports
5. 🔄 **In Progress** - Adding assertions, screenshots, videos, and debug modes
